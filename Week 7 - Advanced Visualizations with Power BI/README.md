# Power BI Interactive Dashboard Deployment: Final Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The implementation of this interactive Power BI dashboard marks a successful transition from static Excel reporting to dynamic, data-driven decision-making. The dashboards provide a comprehensive view across Sales, Supply Chain, and Market Insights. Overall business performance is strong, with **Total Sales reaching 75K**, representing a significant **Year-over-Year (YoY) growth of 35.31%**. Furthermore, total orders (522) and quantity sold (1536) have also seen robust growth exceeding 36%. However, while sales are growing, the supply chain metrics reveal critical bottlenecks that require immediate attention to sustain this momentum.

## Part 1: Answers to Key Business Questions

**1. What are the top 5 performing suppliers or products?**
Based on the "Supply Chain Performance" dashboard, the top performers driving significant revenue are:

* **Top 5 Suppliers (by Sales):**
1. Abshire, Funk and Davis (6.9K)
2. Lueilwitz-Beier (5.0K)
3. Wolf LLC (4.6K)
4. Kozey, Hills and Champlin (4.3K)
5. Hoeger Group (3.1K)
*(Note: The top 5 suppliers account for 42.08% of total supplier sales, with a cumulative volume of 580 units).*


* **Top 5 Products (by Sales):**
1. Chaparral Bellflower (>3K)
2. Keaau Valley Dubautia (~2K)
3. Redbird Flower
4. Imshaug's Tube Lichen
5. Eureka Dunegrass
*(Note: The top 5 products represent 20.39% of total product sales).*



**2. Which product category generates the most activity?**
According to the treemap on the "Client & Market Insights" dashboard, the **Asteraceae** category generates the highest level of client distribution and activity, commanding the largest visual footprint. It is followed by **Fabaceae** and **Poaceae**.

**3. Which region or city contributes the most to the key indicators?**
**China** heavily dominates the market across all key performance indicators. The "Client & Market Insights" pie charts reveal that China accounts for:

* **68.09%** of Total Clients (128 clients).
* **64.42%** of Total Sales Distribution (48.38K).
* **64.26%** of Total Quantity Sold (987 units).
Sweden, Japan, and France follow, but with vastly smaller market shares (all under 10%).

**4. What delays or variances impact overall performance?**
Supply chain delays are a major issue impacting overall performance. The "Shipping Status" donut chart indicates that **36.97% of all shipments are "Delayed"**. When compared to the "Not Delayed" (39.85%) and "In Time" (23.18%) statuses, this reveals that more than one-third of the company's fulfillment pipeline is experiencing friction. The average shipping time sits at 3 days, but the volume of delayed orders—particularly in the primary market (China)—threatens customer satisfaction.

**5. Which segments or clients need special attention to improve performance?**

* **Geographic Segments:** Markets outside of China (Sweden, Japan, France, Canada) require attention. Their current contribution is minimal, indicating either an untapped opportunity for market penetration or ineffective regional strategies.
* **Temporal Variance (April 2024 Drop):** The line charts for both Sales and Quantity (2023-2024) show a sharp, alarming drop in April 2024. If this is not due to an incomplete month of data at the time of reporting, clients and segments active during this period require immediate investigation to understand the cause of the sudden decline.

## Part 2: 3 Key Insights

1. **Over-Reliance on a Single Market:** The business is hyper-concentrated in China, which accounts for roughly 65% of all sales, clients, and quantities sold. While this market is highly lucrative, it poses a severe geographic concentration risk if economic conditions or trade policies shift.
2. **High Growth Masking Fulfillment Inefficiencies:** The impressive YoY growth in sales (+35.31%) and orders (+36.20%) is overshadowing a struggling supply chain. With nearly 37% of shipments delayed, the operational side of the business is struggling to keep up with the rising sales demand.
3. **Supplier Concentration is High:** The top 5 suppliers generate 42.08% of the sales volume. "Abshire, Funk and Davis" alone is a massive outlier compared to the rest. This indicates strong strategic partnerships but also highlights a vulnerability if one of these top suppliers experiences disruptions.

## Part 3: Strategic Recommendations

* **Investigate and Optimize the Supply Chain:** The 37% delay rate is unacceptable for long-term growth. Management should conduct a deep-dive analysis into the logistics processes, specifically focusing on the highest-volume routes (like China) to identify bottlenecks.
* **Market Diversification Strategy:** To mitigate risk, the company should develop targeted marketing and sales campaigns aimed at growing secondary markets like Sweden, Japan, and France to balance the portfolio and reduce reliance on China.
* **Investigate the Q2 2024 Drop-off:** The sharp decline shown in the April 2024 trendline must be diagnosed immediately. If the data is complete, the business needs to identify if this is a seasonal trend, a loss of a major client, or a systemic failure, and apply corrective measures.
